90%

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’m doing well at keeping up with the weekly practicals and making sure I ask questions when I’m unsure. This helps me stay on track and understand the concepts better so I’ll keep doing that.

I need to stop leaving some tasks until close to the due date. I should plan better and spread the work out during the week.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Sometimes I rush through practicals without fully reflecting on the design principles. I will slow down a little to make sure I understand why I’m doing things.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I’m doing really well at breaking problems into smaller parts and testing my programs step by step so they work reliably.
