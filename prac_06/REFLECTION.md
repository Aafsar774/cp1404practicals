# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I’ve started spending more time reading the practical instructions carefully, and testing small parts of the program as I go instead of rushing to finish everything at once.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to manage my time better and avoid rushing pracs close to the deadline. I also want to focus more on understanding each concept instead of just getting the code to run.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’m consistent with attending labs

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should make sure I write meaningful commit messages and docstrings and read instructions more carefully

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I’d like to see more real-world or industry-style projects included in the subject. Working on tasks that simulate what professional developers do would make the learning more practical and help build teamwork and problem solving skills.
