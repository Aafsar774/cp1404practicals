# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was mixed at the start. Sometimes I underestimated small tasks because I thought 
they were straightforward but then they took longer. Other times I overestimated the task
because I wasn’t sure how difficult something would be.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, I got better at breaking tasks down and understanding how long certain types of coding 
problems normally take me. I started making more realistic estimates instead of just guessing quickly. 
I also learned to account for unexpected issues like errors or trying new concepts.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that this is a skill that improves with practice. It made me more aware of how I actually 
work and where I tend to get stuck. It also helped me plan my time better and avoid trying to 
finish everything at the last minute.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned that other people notice things I miss, especially small mistakes or style issues.
It helped me improve readability and follow the style guide more closely. It also showed me patterns
in my mistakes that I can avoid in future code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Doing reviews helped me understand different ways to solve the same problem and improved my ability to 
explain feedback clearly and politely.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[PR for prac_08](https://github.com/prabJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/4/files)

### Explanation

This review was good because I gave clear, specific feedback on several files, including fixing incorrect ids,
improving colour values, and suggesting better structure and error handling. I explained why the changes
were needed, not just what to change. The feedback was helpful, readable, and aimed at improving both 
functionality and clarity.

### Good Code Review 2

[PR for prac_06](https://github.com/jc972155/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

This was a good review because I gave clear suggestions to improve code quality, including removing hard 
coded values, fixing naming, simplifying methods, and using if __name__ == "__main__":. I also pointed out 
small style issues and explained why the changes would make the code cleaner and easier to maintain.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add a bit more guidance or short videos for the harder pracs and the Flask and testing ones,
because those introduced new tools that many students had never used before.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

What I did really well was improving my confidence with each prac. At the start I hesitated a lot
but as the weeks went on I got better at trusting myself to solve things. I pushed through errors and 
learned to test small pieces of code as I went. By the end, I was much faster at identifying issues and 
fixing them.
