# Practical 07

This repository contains my practical work for **Week 7**

## About Me

My name is **Aafsar Iqbal**, and I’m a student in the **Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronics)** program
at JCU.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful Names:** Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make code
  self-explanatory.
- **Small, Focused Functions:** Each function should do one thing well, this makes the code easier to test and reuse.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Following PEP 8 and using tools like *Reformat Code* in PyCharm ensures readability.
